# mongodb-dotnet-client-examples
This is a set of examples to show how to work with MongoDb using the .NET client library.

The code is fully documented on my blog in a series dedicated to using MongoDb. 
The series doesn't only cover the usage of the MongoDb .NET client. It also shows lots of pure MongoDb queries:
- CRUD
- querying
- data import
- indexes
- aggregations
- diagnostics

The first part of the series is available here: https://dotnetcodr.com/2016/03/14/introduction-to-mongodb-with-net-part-1-background/
There's a link to the subsequent part at the end of each post.
Links to all parts of the series are listed here: https://dotnetcodr.com/data-storage/
